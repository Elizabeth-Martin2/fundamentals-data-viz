# Fundamentals of Data Visualization

## Final Project Overview
I have used data provided by the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) that analyzes traffic stops across the United States.  The linked website also discusses the findings the team has made and even includes tutorials to duplicate their findings.  Upon further investigation, you will notice that they restrict their analysis to racial groups and perform in-depth analysis to find any evidence of bias. 

In my project, I will expand on the Stanford team's work searching for evidence of bias but this time regarding age and gender.  I will compare the population data to the sample data and use the hit rate test in each category to form a basis for my decision.
> **Hit Rate Test**:
> The “Hit Rate” is calculated by taking the number of hits, in our case, the scenario when the subject was searched & found to be carrying contraband, divided by the total number of occurrences i.e., the total number of times subjects were searched.

> **Important**: It is important to understand the results for the hit rate test.  Having a higher hit rate is the desired outcome.  Say one age group had a hit rate of 80%, this would mean that officers were extra careful to make sure they had a good reason to suspect the subject of carrying contraband.  If another age group had a hit rate of 20%, this would mean that officers were searching this age group for any small suspicion.

## Interactive Visualizations
Visualizations can be found under the `visualizations` folder. To interact with them, copy the vega-lite code from the visualization & plug it into [github's vega editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/).  This will compile & allow you to see & interact with it properly.
